  # Scale factor for resizing the images before generating patches.
  # It has been observed that when using small patch sizes, the model
  # performance is better when the images are resized. For a patch
  # size of 64, a scale factor of 0.5 is recommended and for a patch
  # size of 32, a scale factor of 0.25 is recommended.
